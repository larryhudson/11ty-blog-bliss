## Projects

### Easy Read database (Django + Python)
- When? 2018?
- Why?
  - Working with Microsoft Word documents on a shared network drive - difficult to search across
  - Specifics around Easy Read images
  - Reusing images across multiple documents - lots of copies of images
  - We write alternative text for every image - so we have a solid set of image
    descriptions for searching
  - Needed to deploy on premises so that the database could only be accessed
  when team members are connected to our network VPN - not shared over the
  internet.

I helped plan, design and implement a new product for the Information Access Group - publishing accessible HTML versions of our Easy Read documents.

Easy Read documents are traditionally published as PDF files, but PDF is not a good format for digital accessibility.

I found a way to efficiently generate HTML versions from our MIcrosoft Word working files, and add an automatically-generated audio version using the Microsoft Azure text to speech API.

This format works much better for people with assistive technology and people on mobile devices.

ï‚§	Easy Read online HTML product (2020 - Present): Designed and developed an efficient process for converting Word documents to HTML, and led marketing and client education efforts. Between September 2022 and September 2023, 45% of clients took up the HTML option in their Easy Read projects. Tech: Node.js, Azure APIs, Netlify, Eleventy, Astro.
