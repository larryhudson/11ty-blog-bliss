<p>Here you can find some information about projects I have worked on. These
include work projects and side projects. In each post, I explain the idea or
problem, the solution and what I learned during the project.</p>


<div class="post-list">
  <ul class="no-bullets">
  {% for post in posts %}
    <li>
      {% include "partials/single-project-excerpt.njk" %}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>

{% include "partials/scroll-up-arrow.njk" %}

{%- set totalPages = pagination.pages|length -%}
{%- set currentPage = pagination.pageNumber + 1 -%}
{%- set previousHref = pagination.href.previous -%}
{%- set nextHref = pagination.href.next -%}

{% include "partials/pagination.njk" %}
