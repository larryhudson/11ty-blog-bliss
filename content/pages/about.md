I'm {{ siteConfig.author.name }}. Welcome to my blog!

I'm a web developer and programmer based in Torquay, Australia. I'm the Team
Leader of Innovation, Tech and Web at [the Information Access
Group](https:/www.informationaccessgroup.com), a company
that specialises in accessible communications.

For as long as I can remember I have been interested in computers and the web.
I spent my teenage years making internet friends on Tumblr.
Since doing a programming class in my university degree, I've enjoyed tinkering
with little web apps. You can see a list of half-baked ideas on my [GitHub
profile](https://github.com/larryhudson). Most recently in 2023, I've been playing around with Astro, SQLite,
text-to-speech APIs and the Spotify API.

Outside of programming, I'm a big music fan. You can see the music I listen to
on my [Last.fm profile](https://last.fm/user/harryludson) or have a look at my [Bandcamp collection](https://bandcamp.com/harryludson). I also enjoy history, language learning and coffee.

I try not to spend too much time on social media, but every now and then I post
on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@larryhudson). I spend more time in the
[Shop Talk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/) and [Lunch.dev](https://www.lunch.dev/) Discords.
