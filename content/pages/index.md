I'm an Australian full stack engineer based in Paris, France.

I worked at [the Information Access Group](https://www.informationaccessgroup.com/) between 2017 and 2024, before moving to
Paris.

Here are a few things that I love about my work:
- **creating tools that make other people's work easier** - I'm passionate about using technology to streamline processes and reduce repetitive work so team members can focus on what they do best.
- **sharing knowledge** - when working in a team, it is so important to share what you know and encourage others to do the same. I find it really rewarding to share little tips and help others grow their skills.

During my free time, I like to experiment with new technologies and new ways of
doing things. You can see a list of my side projects and demos on my [GitHub
profile](https://github.com/larryhudson). Most recently in 2024, I've been playing around with the [Astro](https://astro.build/) web framework, the [Weaviate vector database](https://weaviate.io/), and ideas for active music discovery.

Outside of programming, I'm a big music fan. You can see the music I listen to
on my [Last.fm profile](https://last.fm/user/harryludson) or have a look at my [Bandcamp collection](https://bandcamp.com/harryludson). I also enjoy history, language learning and coffee.

I try not to spend too much time on social media, but every now and then I post
on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@larryhudson). I spend more time in the
[Shop Talk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/) and [Lunch.dev](https://www.lunch.dev/) Discords.
