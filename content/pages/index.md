I'm an Australian software engineer based in London, UK.

I'm currently working at [CO2 AI](https://www.co2ai.com/) as a mid-level software engineer — building an end-to-end decarbonisation platform for large corporations to reach Net Zero.

I'm interested in how AI coding tools are changing the way we build software. At work, I'm helping our team use these tools to experiment more, iterate faster and stay aligned. In my spare time, I'm trying to stay on the frontier of AI-assisted engineering, tinkering with new ways to build software with agents.

I'm a big music fan. You can see what I listen to on my [Last.fm profile](https://last.fm/user/harryludson) or my [Bandcamp collection](https://bandcamp.com/harryludson).

You can find more of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/larryhudson).
