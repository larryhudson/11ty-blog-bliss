Summary:
- I led the development of the Everyone Can Work website for Inclusion Australia.
- This was built using WordPress, creating a simple theme from scratch, and using Advanced Custom Fields to allow easy content editing.
- I implemented a custom glossary tooltip feature so that complex words could be defined using a custom post type, and then tooltips could be added so readers could quickly find the definition while they read.


## Why I did this project, why it's exciting

## Background context
- At the Information Access Group, we built simple, accessible websites for our
  clients, often not-for-profit disability organisations.
- The Everyone Can Work website for Inclusion Australia was one of the first
projects where I led the development. During this project, I learned how to make
a WordPress theme from scratch, which was a great learning experience.

## What I did

## What I learned
- I also became more comfortable with Advanced Custom Fields, a plugin which
allows website makers to define editable fields that content authors can use to
edit the content on WordPress pages.
