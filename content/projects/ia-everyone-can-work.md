Summary:
- I led the development of the [Everyone Can Work](https://everyonecanwork.org.au/) website for [Inclusion Australia](https://www.inclusionaustralia.org.au/).
- This was built using WordPress, creating a simple theme from scratch, and using Advanced Custom Fields to allow easy content editing.
- I implemented a custom glossary tooltip feature so that complex words could be defined using a custom post type, and then tooltips could be added so readers could quickly find the definition while they read.


## Why I did this project, why it's exciting

## Background context
- At the [Information Access Group](https://www.informationaccessgroup.com/), we build simple, accessible websites for our
  clients, often not-for-profit disability organisations.
- The [Everyone Can Work](https://everyonecanwork.org.au/) website for [Inclusion Australia](https://www.inclusionaustralia.org.au/) was one of the first
projects where I led the development. During this project, I learned how to make
a WordPress theme from scratch, which was a great learning experience.

## Custom glossary tooltips
- Across the resources on this project, Inclusion Australia needed to explain
some complex concepts. We decided to implement a 'glossary' using WordPress
custom post types.

## What I did

## What I learned
- I became more comfortable with Advanced Custom Fields, a plugin which
allows website makers to define editable fields that content authors can use to
edit the content on WordPress pages.
