- I've always been the type of music fan that listens to albums. Ever since I
  was about thirteen, my music discovery has revolved around albums.
- But in the last year, I've been experimenting with different ways to find and
  enjoy music.
- Every Noise at Once's algorithmic playlists for microgenres are an interesting
  way to find new music. If you find a genre you like, you can check out the
  'sound', 'pulse' and 'edge' playlists to find out what other fans of the genre
  are listening to. This is different because it separates the songs from the
  artist's release (eg. album or EP) and puts it in a different context.
- Listening to Every Noise at Once playlists, you realise there is a practically
  infinite amount of music out there to enjoy. You will never run out of music
  to listen to. This is a revelation for someone that grew up downloading albums
  and loading them onto my iPod, which could only hold a couple thousand songs.
- Using my web app discover-mix, you can generate playlists with thousands of
  songs to explore, just in a few clicks.
- Another way of listening to music is to listen to DJ mixes. You can find
  thousands of 1-2 hour mixes on Soundcloud that are free to listen to. Once you
  find a DJ you like, you can listen to their mixes, look them up on Resident
  Advisor, see other DJs performing at the same events, and continue exploring.
- DJ mixes are different to albums because you don't need to listen to them over
  and over again to enjoy them. The enjoyment of the music is more 'in the
  moment'. Hearing the music in a context where it is being cut up and remixed,
  it's less about the individual songs and more about the journey of where the mix
  is going.
- This probably sounds obvious to people who enjoy DJ mixes and dance music, but
  it's been a revelation from my perspective, of someone who has enjoyed music
  in a fairly narrow way up until now.
