- In general, I have a hard time doing the things I really want to do. Even
  though I have a few interests and hobbies, including reading, history, language
  learning and music, sometimes I have trouble actively pursuing them.
- Even when I think of things to do, sometimes I waste my time scrolling through
  social media or YouTube etc. Time can slip away when you're doing the easy,
  passive things that feel good in the moment.

## A system for organising ideas

- I'm trying out a new way of organising the ideas of things that I want to do.
- I have a Notion setup with three linked databases:
  - **Areas** - these are my different hobbies and areas of my life, e.g.
    reading, history, exercise, music, learning, admin, relationship, family,
    friends, programming, career.
  - **Ideas** - these are things that pop into my head of things I'd like to do or
    things that I need to do. They are linked to an area above. They have a
    'status' column to keep track of what is not started, in progress or complete.
  - **Time blocking** - these are time entries of when I'm spending time devoted to
    the ideas above. Time entries are linked to an idea.
- This setup makes it easy to:
  - quickly jot down an idea when it comes into my mind.
  - look at my list of ideas when I have some free time.
  - review what I'm spending my time on, to make sure I have a good balance of
    interests. If I spend too much time on one thing, I can get burned out.
- I'm not sure if this setup is going to last. I tend to go through phases of
  motivation where I'm really into something, and then I lose interest. But I'm
  hopeful this will stick.
