- For the last few months, I've been using a little second hand computer as my
  desktop computer for software development.
- It's a little Lenovo ThinkCentre M920q Tiny PC. I got it for AU$180. It's got
  16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD.
- I installed Arch Linux (btw) on it - it's my first time using Arch and it's
  been a good learning experience. I'm using the XFCE desktop environment and have
  two apps - my web browser and my terminal.
- 16GB feels like a lot of RAM when you're just working in a terminal and using
  a web browser. Because Arch doesn't come with any extra software, the computer
  is not doing much at any one time. Which is good!
- At the same time, I've been learning how to use tmux and Neovim. It was pretty
  uncomfortable getting started with Vim motions as everything felt sluggish,
  but I'm getting better. For a long time I couldn't get the muscle memory of J
  for down and K for up!
- For me there's something nostalgic about Linux and keeping things really
  simple on your computer. While computers are getting more and more powerful, and
  our smartphones are becoming our main computers, having a simple desktop that
  feels like it's from the early 2000s feels good to me. I still like my M1
  MacBook Air, but it's a different feeling.
