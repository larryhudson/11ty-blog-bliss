In March 2024, I wrote an article for the [Information Access Group newsletter](https://www.informationaccessgroup.com/newsletter.html) about how text-to-speech can make your content more accessible, aimed at content authors and readers.

For this article, we implemented a 'Listen' button that allows you to listen to
the article while you read. This is the same functionality that the [Easy Read
HTML product](https://www.informationaccessgroup.com/our_services/easy_read_html.html) uses.

You can [read the article on the Information Access Group
website](https://www.informationaccessgroup.com/news/text_to_speech_audio_accessibility.html).
